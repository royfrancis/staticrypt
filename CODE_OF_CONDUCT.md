The code of conduct is here to set the tone of contributions to StatiCrypt, help turn difficult situations into growth, and make our little corner of the internet a nice and healthy one. ðŸŒ±

1. **Assume good intentions**

   English might not be everyone's first language and nuances might be lost. Don't use sarcasm or assume others are. Things that look trivial or inept to you might be genuinely important for someone else.

2. **Be constructive**

   Don't just use dismissive comments ("this sucks", "this is obviously wrong"). Try to stay as factual and concrete as possible ("this will cause problem X if Y happens"), make "I" statement ("my experience is...") and remember everything is a trade-off (though of course, some trade-offs are much better suited than others for this project).

3. **Be kind**

   We all have a limited time being alive, and we all die in the end. Let's not waste energy on things that don't matter. Let's be kind to each other.

I wanna add "Be patient" as this is a side project for everyone and we all have busy lives on the side, but I feel I'm by far the slowest one to respond here so you guys would be the only ones needing to apply it... Let's say it's included in the "Be Kind" rule and thanks for your patience anyway - I really appreciate it!
